The movie stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, and Marion Cotillard.\\n\\nThe film\\'s plot revolves around Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled thief who specializes in entering people\\'s dreams and stealing their secrets. Cobb is offered a chance to redeem himself by performing an impossible task: planting an idea in someone\\'s mind instead of stealing one. This process is known as \"inception.\"\\n\\nCobb and his team, including Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Elliot Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), and Saito (Ken Watanabe), embark on a mission to plant an idea in the mind of Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy), the son of a dying business magnate. The team faces numerous challenges as they navigate through multiple levels of dreams within dreams, all while trying to stay one step ahead of their enemies.\\n\\nInception received widespread critical acclaim for its original storyline, clever plot twists, and impressive visual effects. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $825 million worldwide. It also received eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, and won four Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Visual Effects.\\n\\nThe movie\\'s themes of reality, identity, and the power of the human mind have sparked intense debates and discussions among fans and critics alike. The film\\'s ending, in particular, has been the subject of much speculation, with many interpreting the final scene as either a dream or reality.\\n\\nOverall, Inception is a thought-provoking, visually stunning, and action-packed movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.')], 'output': \"Leonardo DiCaprio has starred in many movies throughout his career.
